## About PartyPool
PartyPool is an Android based mobile application designed by Team 3 (MONT3) for Team Project designed to allow users to vote for the music they want at parties. Users host "Parties" and share a unique 4-digit password amongst guests which is used to join the party. The host (or "DJ") then uploads songs to a "Pool" of tracks, which the guests then vote on in order to determine which song gets played next. 

Voting takes place using one of two modes, "Continuous" or "Party".

Continuous voting takes place for the duration of the currently playing song. All users can view the entire playlist, and vote as and when they feel like it for the next track they want to hear. 

Party mode voting is a more fast paced variant, where four random songs are selected from the playlist (as well as the option to vote for a completely random song). Voting takes place over a 30 second slot, and the winner is played next. The user in this mode cannot see which songs are in the playlist or the current status of the vote, this is designed to keep votes exciting, but minimise the need for users to keep browsing their screen.

## Future Expansion
- IOS Version.
- Integrate Spotify/Apple Music. Allow users to add and vote on songs pulled in from streaming services.
- Gamification - Provide functionallity for users to compete for control of the playlist through games and quizzes to make the app more interactive and engage guests more.
- Club/Business version - Support for large scale venues. Allowance for "PartyPool Parties" where patrons control what plays.
